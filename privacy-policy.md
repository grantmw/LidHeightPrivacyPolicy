## Collection of Routine Information

LidHeight does not require their users to create or have an account to use the application. From this LidHeight gathers little to no information on the user. The little information the application does create is briefly used to calculate the palpebral fissure height of the user and is then displayed on the users screen. Only getting store for no more than a few milliseconds. 


## Data Use and Sharing

As previously stated above, LidHeight does not store their users data beyond real time application. In addition, LidHeight does not work with any third party sources whatsoever. This includes distribution of user data for marketing, advertising or use-based data mining, including by third parties. 


## Security

We understand personal information is important to our user base. That is why we do not store any data whatsoever. Once your palpebral fissure height is calculated the data is lost forever. Unfortunately, if the user denies LidHeight access to their camera this will eliminate all functionality of the application.
