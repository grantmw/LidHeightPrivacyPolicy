# Privacy Policy

LidHeight takes your privacy seriously. To better protect your privacy LidHeight provides this privacy policy notice explaining the way your personal information is collected and used.


## Collection of Routine Information

LidHeight requires access to the camera on users' mobile devices and iPads. If you wish to change our access or permissions, you may do so in your device's settings. LidHeight does not require their users to create or have an account to use the application. From this, LidHeight gathers no information on the user. The application uses depth-sensing capabilities in the mobile device or iPad camera to calculate and display the palpebral fissure height and pupillary distance of the user. That is, LidHeight uses geometrical and face data provided by Apple's TrueDepth camera system. Using that data, we make simple calculations and display them on the screen. However, there is no collection of any data. There are no user accounts. 


## Data Use and Sharing

As previously stated above, LidHeight does not store their users data beyond real time application. Using Apple's TrueDepth technology, LidHeight examines face and 3D geometrical data to calculate the distance between eye lids (PFH) and the distance between the pupils (pupilar distance). There is no collection, sharing, or retention of this data. In addition, LidHeight does not work with any third party sources whatsoever. This includes distribution of user data for marketing, advertising or user-based data mining, including by third parties. No personal data of users is collected or stored. No derivative data is stored or collected. Third party affiliations do no exist in any form; there is no sharing of data in any form. In summation, measurements are made with information provided by Apple's TrueDepth camera technology. There are real-time calculations that occur, but there is no collection, retention, or sharing of any data. There is no data collection in any fashion; therefore, there is no sharing of data to any degree. 


## Security

We understand personal information is important to our user base. That is why we do not store any data whatsoever. Once your palpebral fissure height is calculated the data is lost forever. Unfortunately, if the user denies LidHeight access to their camera this will eliminate all functionality of the application. 


## Data Retention

We use geometrical and face data provided by Apple's TrueDepth camera system. Using that face data, we make simple calculations and display them on the screen. There is no retention of data: measurements are made live and real-time. 


## Changes To This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of July 23rd, 2020 and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.
We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically.


## Disclosure

There are no disclosures or conflicts of interest regarding face data or otherwise.


## Disclaimer

Lid Height cannot dictate treatment and has no diagnostic value. Ophthalmic or medical concerns should be discussed with your physician.
